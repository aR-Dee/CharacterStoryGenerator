### A very simple character and story generator

Free to use and spark your ideas to draw or whatever really :D

check URL - https://ar-dee.github.io/CharacterStoryGenerator/

## OR

you can pick up parts and pieces to create your own

## BUT

I would be MORE than happy to work further on it with someone !!!




### Solution components:
- character, place, action JSON files are text feed components for the generator
- randomizer.js - whole logic is there 
- randomizer.py - initially started with this but GitPages would not run it, hence throwing all to the client via JS
